There are various state management techniques in Flutter

1 - Getx

-	Its role is the same as that of a provider, it is used to manage the state of the applications 
    and ensure off payload on the mobile application and its widgets.
-	With GETX, we can have easy creation of snack bar, bottom Sheet, dialog box and changing theme 
    of the mobile applications.
-	It Can be done using Get.snackbar, Get.defalutdialog, Get.ChangeTheme and more.

2 - provider

-	It is commonly used to efficiently share and update data between different parts of your app, such as widgets, 
    without the need for prop drilling (passing data through multiple widget layers).
-	By number there are 2 types of provider, a single provider called through the function ChangeNotifierProvider 
    and multiple provider â€“ Multipleprovider ().
